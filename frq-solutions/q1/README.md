# 2024 Question 1

## This question is about...
- Create methods to simulate the amount of food is eaten and amount of food in the feeder


## Struggles with this question...
- I didn't use the Math.random() for the normal and abnormal conditions
- Instead of using a while loop, I used a for loop


## Prior experiences that helped...
- Time spended on learning Math.random()
  

## What I learned by doing this question...
- Need to +1 to maximum in the Math.random(), so it can inclusive the number from the beginning to the end
